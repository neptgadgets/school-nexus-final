# PostgreSQL Integration Complete

## Overview
The SchoolNexus Multi-School Management System has been successfully migrated from Supabase to PostgreSQL with custom authentication and API implementation. All dashboard pages now use real data from the PostgreSQL database.

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Updated all components and pages to use new API utilities

### 2. PostgreSQL Database Integration
- ✅ Created comprehensive database schema with 20+ tables
- ✅ Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Added database migrations and seed data
- ✅ Created connection pooling with node-postgres (pg)
- ✅ Implemented transaction support and error handling

### 3. Custom Authentication System
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, teacher, student, parent)
- ✅ Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- ✅ Middleware for route protection and authorization
- ✅ Login/logout API endpoints

### 4. Comprehensive API Routes
Created 10+ API routes for all dashboard data:
- ✅ /api/students - Student management with pagination and filtering
- ✅ /api/teachers - Teacher data with class and student counts
- ✅ /api/classes - Class information with enrollment data
- ✅ /api/attendance - Attendance tracking with statistics
- ✅ /api/grades - Grade management with analytics
- ✅ /api/assignments - Assignment tracking with submissions
- ✅ /api/fees - Fee management with payment status
- ✅ /api/library - Library books and transaction management
- ✅ /api/notifications - System notifications
- ✅ /api/dashboard/stats - Real-time dashboard analytics

### 5. Dashboard Pages Updated
